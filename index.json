However, partial utterances do not necessarily contain enough information to be mapped to the intent class of their complete utterance (correctly and with a certain degree of confidence). Using the final interpretation as the ground truth to measure a classifier‚Äôs accuracy during intent classification of partial utterances is thus problematic. We release inCLINC, a dataset of partial and full utterances with human annotations of plausible intent labels for different portions of each utterance, as an upper (human) baseline for incremental intent classification. We analyse the incremental annotations and propose entropy reduction as a measure of human annotators‚Äô convergence on an interpretation (i.e. intent label). We argue that, when the annotators do not converge to one or a few possible interpretations and yet the classifier already identifies the final intent class early on, it is a sign of overfitting that can be ascribed to artefacts in the dataset.","tags":["incremental intent Classification","NLU","Data-centric","Information Density"],"title":"Not So Fast, Classifier ‚Äì Accuracy and Entropy Reduction in Incremental Intent Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandra Zarcone","Vera Demberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627257600,"objectID":"0c497bd37c85ef6cf6491197e555640e","permalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2021-discproc/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2021-discproc/","section":"publication","summary":"There is now a well-established literature showing that people anticipate upcoming concepts and words during language processing.

One way to make SA interactions more natural is to train the underlying natural language processing modules on data which reflects how humans would talk to a SA if it was capable of understanding and producing natural dialogue given a specific task. Such data can be collected applying a Wizard-of-Oz approach (WOz), where user and system side are played by humans. WOz allows researchers to simulate human-machine interaction while benefitting from the fact that all participants are human and thus dialogue-competent. More recent approaches have leveraged simple templates specifying a dialogue scenario for crowdsourcing large-scale datasets. Template-based collection efforts, however, come at the cost of data diversity and naturalness. We present a method to crowdsource dialogue data for the SA domain in the WOz framework, which aims at limiting researcher-induced bias in the data while still allowing for a low-resource, scalable data collection. Our method can also be applied to languages other than English (in our case German), for which fewer crowd-workers may be available. We collected data asynchronously, relying only on existing functionalities of Amazon Mechanical Turk, by formulating the task as a dialogue continuation task. Coherence in dialogues is ensured, as crowd-workers always read the dialogue history, and as a unifying scenario is provided for each dialogue. In order to limit bias in the data, rather than using template-based scenarios, we handcrafted situated scenarios which aimed at not pre-script-ing the task into every single detail and not priming the participants‚Äô lexical choices. Our scenarios cued people‚Äôs knowledge of common situations and entities relevant for our task, without directly mentioning them, but relying on vague language and circumlocutions. We compare our data (which we publish as the CROWDSS corpus; n = 113 dialogues) with data from MultiWOZ, showing that our scenario approach led to considerably less scripting and priming and thus more ecologically-valid dialogue data. This suggests that small investments in the collection setup can go a long way in improving data quality, even in a low-resource setup.","tags":["Human-Machine Interaction","Wizard-of-Oz","Data-centric"],"title":"Crowdsourcing ecologically-valid dialogue data for German","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619010000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619010000,"objectID":"c37fb9cd8c648c0f21f91bbe49b28bdc","permalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/talk/hey-google-wie-sorgt-man-fur-gendergerechtigtkeit-in-der-maschinellen-sprachverarbeitung/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/talk/hey-google-wie-sorgt-man-fur-gendergerechtigtkeit-in-der-maschinellen-sprachverarbeitung/","section":"event","summary":"An example talk using Wowchemy's Markdown slides feature.","tags":[],"title":"Hey Google, wie sorgt man f√ºr Gendergerechtigtkeit in der Maschinellen Sprachverarbeitung?","type":"event"},{"authors":["Alessandra Zarcone","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

For example, when they process the expression 'begin the book', they understand it involves an event which is not explicitly mentioned (e.g. 'begin reading the book'). This thesis looks at these constructions, known as logical metonymies, which combine an event-selecting verb and entity-denoting object and involve covert events. Logical metonymies are an interesting challenge for theories of lexical semantics: they need to be reconciled with compositionality, they require the integration of context (writers typically write books, students typically read them), and they lie at the interface between lexicon and world knowledge (is the information that books are read stored in our mental lexicon or in our world knowledge?).\nI critically analyze previous hypotheses on logical metonymy with regard to the answer they provide to two core problems: the source problem (what events are retrieved? what type of event knowledge is assumed?) and the trigger problem (why do some constructions trigger a metonymic interpretation and others do not?). Lexicalist approaches claim that the metonymy arises from a type clash between the event-selecting verb and an entity-denoting object, and posit complex lexical items, encoding event information about artifacts (e.g. book ‚Üí read), to explain the recovery of covert events. Pragmatic-based approaches argue against the idea that lexical items have an internal structure, suggesting that covert events arise from the underspecification of a logical metonymy and are inferred via non-lexical knowledge. I look with particular attention at the role of event knowledge, which lexicalist approaches place in our mental lexicon, while pragmatic-based approaches place it in our world knowledge.\nI propose a third hypothesis, based on thematic fit and generalized event knowledge of typical events and their participants, which have been shown to guide efficient incremental processing: I argue that contextual elements cue generalized event knowledge, which plays a key role in determining the covert event for a logical metonymy. I explore this hypothesis from an interdisciplinary perspective, employing both psycholinguistic experiments and computational models, in order to seek converging evidence and confront it with the theoretical investigation. The results from the psycholinguistic experiments and from the computational (distributional) models support the hypothesis that covert event retrieval is guided by generalized event knowledge. I also employ the computational models to analyze previous experimental results and to explore the hypothesis that thematic fit, informed by generalized event knowledge, is ultimately responsible for the trigger of the logical metonymy. I then report on more psycholinguistic evidence showing that a notion of type is indeed necessary to account for differences between metonymic and non-metonymic constructions, and that both type and thematic fit play a role in logical metonymy interpretation. Lastly, I argue for a context-sensitive model of logical metonymy interpretation that exploits an information-rich lexicon, but needs to rethink the notion of type and reconcile it with the notion of thematic fit.","tags":["logical metonymy","complement coercion","lexical meaning in context","world knowledge","expectation-based processing","distributional semantics"],"title":"Event Knowledge and Models of Logical Metonymy Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1339509600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1339509600,"objectID":"f9d3029b34dd77a94276c6e442c611a9","permalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/talk/event-knowledge-and-typicality-in-logical-metonymy-beyond-type-clash/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/talk/event-knowledge-and-typicality-in-logical-metonymy-beyond-type-clash/","section":"event","summary":"Talk on the plausibility-driven interpretation of covert events.","tags":[],"title":"Event knowledge and typicality in logical metonymy: beyond type clash","type":"event"},{"authors":["Alessandra Zarcone","Stefan Rued"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1337558400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1337558400,"objectID":"a6d7d4c273c4d4282cdca6349c950a9d","permalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2012-lrec/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2012-lrec/","section":"publication","summary":"Logical metonymies like 'The author began the book' involve the interpretation of events that are not realized in the sentence (Covert events: 'writing the book'). The Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995) provides a qualia-based account of covert event interpretation, claiming that the covert event is retrieved from the qualia structure of the object. Such a theory poses the question of to what extent covert events in logical metonymies can be accounted for by qualia structures. Building on previous work on English, we present a corpus study for German verbs 'anfangen (mit)','aufhoeren (mit)', 'beenden', 'beginnen (mit)', 'geniessen', based on data obtained from the deWaC corpus. We built a corpus of logical metonymies, which were manually annotated and compared with the qualia structures of their objects, then we contrasted annotation results from two expert annotators for metonymies 'The author began the book') and long forms 'The author began reading the book' across verbs. Our annotation was evaluated on a sample of sentences annotated by a group of naive annotators on a crowdsourcing platform. The logical metonymy database (2661 metonymies and 1886 long forms) with two expert annotations is freely available for scientific research purposes.","tags":["logical metonymy","complement coercion","German","lexical meaning in context"],"title":"Logical metonymies and qualia structures: an annotated database of logical metonymies for German","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1323166500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1323166500,"objectID":"67754a6a738337eb782beb2215b39eb0","permalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/talk/metodi-di-crowdsourcing-nello-studio-del-linguaggio/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/talk/metodi-di-crowdsourcing-nello-studio-del-linguaggio/","section":"event","summary":"Presentazione in occasione di un evento per i dottorandi in linguistica dell'Universit√† di Pisa.","tags":[],"title":"Metodi di crowdsourcing nello studio del linguaggio","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1279638000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1279638000,"objectID":"977d116c7e04101266dfaec64f49e638","permalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/talk/implicit-events-for-event-/entity-ambiguous-nouns/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/talk/implicit-events-for-event-/entity-ambiguous-nouns/","section":"event","summary":"Talk on the plausibility-driven interpretation of covert events.","tags":[],"title":"Implicit Events for Event-/Entity-Ambiguous Nouns","type":"event"},{"authors":["Alessandra Zarcone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1237248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1237248000,"objectID":"9aaf432bd3fbc85554711dd354104e99","permalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2009-mathesis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2009-mathesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Event types (ET) have been widely addressed in linguistics literature, but have received little attention in psycholinguitics, neurolinguistics and computational linguistics research. This thesis dissertation explores the nature of event types from a cognitive point of view: many descriptions and diagnostics on event types are available, but few studies have dealt with the problem of how event types are represented and processed in the mental lexicon. An important prerequisite for this sort of research is the building of a corpus of stimuli that meets our needs (web-based pre-tests were run to test the reliability of the stimuli, which should be balanced to control the variables known to affect processing costs) and an analysis of pre-existing literature in experimental psycholinguistics of event types. Our main concern was to explore new experimental settings in verb semantics psycholinguistics and to adapt them to this specific type of investigation: the choice of the method was narrowed down to the semantic priming paradigm, although the set of stimuli could also be suitable for other experimental settings, such as reading-time studies. The semantic priming paradigm was exploited to contrast processing effects on achievement verbs and activity verbs, which differ with respect to two superordinate features: durativity and resultativity. A series of priming experiments were run to explore differences and interactions between such features and the tense morphology and to evaluate the different contribution of the experimental setting in the observation and measurement of the effect: experiment 1 and experiment 2 followed a similar design and contrasted the effects of different neutral primes; experiment 3 focused on the interaction between event types and Italian tense morphology","tags":["lexical aspect","Maximum Enthropy","lexical meaning in context"],"title":"Empirical correlates of event types - a priming study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandra Zarcone","Alessandro Lenci"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1211760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1211760000,"objectID":"e1c00b40bbc5b598a45105e69f620e79","permalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2008-lrec/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2008-lrec/","section":"publication","summary":"Verb lexical semantic properties are only one of the factors that contribute to the determination of the event type expressed by a sentence, which is instead the result of a complex interplay between the verb meaning and its linguistic context. We report on two computational models for the automatic identification of event type in Italian. Both models use linguistically-motivated features extracted from Italian corpora. The main goal of our experiments is to evaluate the contribution of different types of linguistic indicators to identify the event type of a sentence, as well as to model various cases of context-driven event type shift. In the first model, event type identification has been modelled as a supervised classification task, performed with Maximum Entropy classifiers. In the second model, Self-Organizing Maps have been used to define and identify event types in an unsupervised way. The interaction of various contextual factors in determining the event type expressed by a sentence makes event type identification a highly challenging task. Computational models can help us to shed new light on the real structure of event type classes as well as to gain a better understanding of context-driven semantic shifts.","tags":["lexical aspect","lexical meaning in context","Maximum Entropy","supervised learning","Self-Organizing Maps","unsupervised learning"],"title":"Computational Models for Event Type Classification in Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandra Zarcone"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1160611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1160611200,"objectID":"f8f3d73e73d07a48cff9bb9f992dc9c0","permalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2006-bscthesis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"alessandrazarcone.de/publication/2006-bscthesis/","section":"publication","summary":"La presente relazione illustra i primi risultati di un'analisi computazionale dell'azionalit√† del verbo italiano, seguendo l'ipotesi (presentata per l'inglese americano da Siegel e McKeown (2000)) che specifici indicatori contestuali presenti in una frase possano fornire delle informazioni rilevanti sulla categoria azionale del verbo della frase stessa.
