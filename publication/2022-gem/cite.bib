    abstract = "The Semantic textual similarity (STS) task is commonly used to evaluate the semantic
    representations that language models (LMs) learn from texts, under the assumption that good-quality
    representations will yield accurate similarity estimates. When it comes to estimating the similarity
    of two utterances in a dialogue, however, the conversational context plays a particularly important
    role. We argue for the need of benchmarks specifically created using conversational data in order
    to evaluate conversational LMs in the STS task. We introduce GiCCS, a first conversational STS
    evaluation benchmark for German. We collected the similarity annotations for GiCCS using best-worst
    scaling and presenting the target items in context, in order to obtain highly-reliable context-
    dependent similarity scores. We present benchmarking experiments for evaluating LMs on capturing
    the similarity of utterances. Results suggest that pretraining LMs on conversational data and
    providing conversational context can be useful for capturing similarity of utterances in dialogues.
    GiCCS is publicly available to encourage benchmarking of conversational LMs.",
